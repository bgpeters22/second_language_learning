The following data set is associated with the paper "A Quantitative Competitive Study of Virtual World Language Learning Compared to Classical Classroom Training". The research effort represented in this paper was funded by the Army Research Office.  The authors are grateful to the Army Research Office for their financial support.

This paper examines effectiveness of the Alelo (TLT) package for teaching Tactical French for the Sahel Africa. The results are a comparison in which the Alelo TLT software is competed against classical, classroom teaching to determine if either method is superior. The study includes two groups with n = 31 for the Alelo group and n = 33 for the classical group to compare exam results through a test of hypothesis. With a p value of 0.309, no significant difference was found between the performance of the two test groups. Therefore, the hypothesis that the two educational methods were equal cannot be statistically rejected.

## Introduction

Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) is represented by multiple forms of new technology to support language learning.  The pedagogical progress includes the rise of computer language learning systems such as the commercially successful Rosetta Stone language learning system.  Another successful CALL package is produced by Alelo (www.alelo.com) as their Tactical Language Training (TLT) system.  The development of the Alelo TLT system was supported by the US DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) as a collaborative project with the University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute. 

Of course, the Alelo TLT is only one of many CALL software packages using new technologies. In order to improve these CALL software packages and to understand their role in the world of language learning, the evaluation of effectiveness must be undertaken, which has been conducted in this study. The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the software by Alelo 1) improves the second-language proficiency of its users and 2) is more effective at improving second-language proficiency than a traditional classroom.  Therefore, it is important to know if the virtual environments training provided by the Alelo software effectively teaches a second language to people when compared to more classical methods.  To determine if the software improves the subjects’ second-language proficiency, the subjects each take a pre-test and post-test. These tests are developed by a college French teacher who is the second author of the paper cited above.

In order to conduct this experiment, two groups were created: the Alelo Group and the Classroom Group. The groups consisted of similar sample sizes.  The subjects in the Alelo Group were trained as approximately 4 subjects at a time while the subjects in the classroom group were trained with usually about 8 students.  In addition, the Alelo Group was trained first as one part of this blocked study.  After the tests from that group were collected, the Classroom Group was trained. The experiment was completed following the conclusion of the Classroom Group.  After the experiment was completed, exams were graded, and results were analyzed.

For both test groups, subjects were administered a pre-test.  Upon concluding their training, the subjects were administered a post-test.  Exams were coded and given to the Classroom training teacher for grading.  Both the pre-test and post-test consist of 20 questions (4 voice recording questions and 16 multiple choice or matching questions).  Each question is worth 5 points and the subject must answer all components of the question correctly to receive credit.  To determine if this training improved the subjects’ French language proficiency, scores from the tests were analyzed.  Analysis of these scores consists of three parts: testing if either method effectively improved the subjects’ French language proficiency, testing if one class type performed better than the other, and testing if the improvement in scores is correlated to any experimental factors (i.e. gender, subject number, and days to complete testing).  Before analyzing the test scores, the experiment’s demographic data is provided.  The experimental factors are related to the demographic data.

To eliminate bias in the grading process, the tests were coded so the teacher would not know whether the subject was from the Alelo Group or the Classroom Group.  The teacher grades all the exams, without knowing to which group any exam belonged.  The results are then delivered for analysis.  The code is reversed, and the appropriate statistical analysis is conducted.

The following is a description of the data collected from the experiment.

## Virtual World Language Learning Data
<a name="alelo"></a>

The Alelo Group’s experiment lasts for three days for each subject. The three days are not necessarily consecutive.  However, the three days are completed within a full week. The first day of the Alelo Group’s experiment lasts four hours.  They are given a subject number and a set of headphones with a built in microphone.

Each subject takes a pre-test.  Before taking the test, the subject views a tutorial on how to answer the different types of questions on the test.  The test has three types of questions: multiple choice, matching, and voice response.  A multiple-choice question provides a question with different answer choices, but only one correct choice.  Matching problems require the subjects to match a list of words or phrases to their respective translations.  Finally, the voice response questions provide a phrase or a list of phrases to speak into a microphone.  

After completing ten hours, each subject takes their post-test.  The post test is simply the other version of the test that the subject did not take at the beginning.  For example, odd-numbered subjects take Test 1 at the beginning and Test 2 as their final test and even-numbered subjects take Test 2 at the beginning and Test 1 upon completion of the training.

### Variables
* Recruited Subject Number - This is the initial subject number tied to the participant. Some participants dropped the study, so the Subject Number is not sequential.
* Corrected Subject Number - This is a corrected subject number tied to the participant, such that the number is sequential. This accounts for participants who dropped the study. 
* Class Type - All participants in the "virtual world classroom" arm of the study are marked as "Alelo". 
* Gender - Denotes the gender of participant with two options: Male, Female
* Subject # - Participants with an odd Recruited Subject Number received a distinct test protocol for the 1st Take round of testing, compared to participants with an even Recruited Subject Number. For the Final Take round of testing, participants with the odd Recruited Subject Number received the test protocol initially given to those participants with an even Recruited Subject Number. Vice versa, participants with an even Recruited Subject Number received the test protocol initially given to participants with an odd Recruited Subject Number during the Final Take of testing. 
* Days - This is the duration of days the participant took the test. Participants were advised to take both test within 3 days. The data shows some participants took longer. The minimum is 3 and maximum is 8 for the Alelo class type.
* Q1 - The participant score on chapter 1 quiz.
* Q2 - The participant score on chapter 2 quiz.
* Q3 - The participant score on chapter 3 quiz.
* Q4 - The participant score on chapter 4 quiz.
* Q5 - The participant score on chapter 5 quiz.

* Q8 - The participant score on chapter 8 quiz.
* Q9 - The participant score on chapter 9 quiz.
* Q10 - The participant score on chapter 10 quiz.
* Quiz Average - This is the participant's average score out of 10 quiz scores, ranging from Q1 through Q10.
* 1st Take (Percent Correct) - This is the percent of correct answers the participant received on their 1st take of the test. 
* Final Take (Percent Correct) - This is the percent of correct answers the participant received on their final take of the test. 
* Percent Change - This is the difference between Final Take (Percent Correct) and 1st Take (Percent Correct)

## Classical Classroom Training Data
<a name="classical"></a>

The experimental process for the Classroom Group is similar to that of the Alelo Group.  For example, on the first and last day, the subjects take their test with the version of the test depending on whether they are odd-numbered or even-numbered.  Again, they are provided with headphones with built-in microphones.  Ten hours are used for the class. During the class, each subject is provided a spiral notebook to take notes in class.  On the first day, the subjects are in class for three hours following their pre-test. On the second day, the subjects have class for four hours. On the final day, the subjects have class for another three hours to complete the class. They conclude with a post-test where they do not have access to their notes.  Again, the odd numbered subjects take Test 1 as the pre-test and Test 2 as the post test, while the even numbered subjects take Test 2 as the pre-test and Test 1 as the post test.

### Variables
* Recruited Subject Number - This is the initial subject number tied to the participant. Some participants dropped the study, so the Subject Number is not sequential.
* Corrected Subject Number - This is a corrected subject number tied to the participant, such that the number is sequential. This accounts for participants who dropped the study. 
* Class Type - All participants in the "virtual world classroom" arm of the study are marked as "Classroom".
* Gender - Denotes the gender of participant with two options: Male, Female
* Subject # - Participants with an odd Recruited Subject Number received a distinct test protocol for the 1st Take round of testing, compared to participants with an even Recruited Subject Number. For the Final Take round of testing, participants with the odd Recruited Subject Number received the test protocol initially given to those participants with an even Recruited Subject Number. Vice versa, participants with an even Recruited Subject Number received the test protocol initially given to participants with an odd Recruited Subject Number during the Final Take of testing. 
* Days - This is the duration of days the participant took the test. Participants were advised to take both test within 3 days. The data shows some participants took longer. The minimum is 3 and maximum is 6 for the Classroom class type.
